first we take normal html skeleton and insert react cdn links in .html file from react website

after that write react code of 
const heading = React.createElement('h1',{id:'heading'},'innerHTML of created element')
first we need to use React keyword then attach createElement() that function take 3 argument and 1st is element to be created
2nd is an object in which we write what are the attribute of created element 
3rd is the context or innerHTML of that tag

then
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
in this ReactDOM create a parent Root by taking the id of parant root 

then
root.render('heading')
in this root viz parant div render heading element inside it.
